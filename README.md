<h3>Koana - An E-Commerce and Cafe Site</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>This is my first assignment for Nucamp, where I will be creating an e-commerce site for my friend who is the owner of a coffee establishment in Hawaii.<p>
<p>The products are high quality coffee, tea and food items produced exclusively from Hawaii and Japan. Interestingly, the establishment is a reclaimed general shop, which preserves its original structure and the spirit of the local area. There's an interesting dynamic between the products available, the shop's environment, and its friendly music and conversation.<p>
<p>The objective of this project is to not only create a mobile first, functional design, but to encompass this dynamic.</p>

<h4>Part 1 - Landing Page</h4>
<p>Using Bootstrap and Javascript, create a mobile first landing page which includes breakpoints for larger viewports.<p>
<ul><h5>Features:</h5>
    <li>Navbar with collapsible menu on smaller viewports</li>
    <li>Highlighted menu items with captions enclosed in individual forms</li>
    <li>Individual links within each product's form which takes the user either to the online store or directly to the shopping cart</li>
    <li>Footer including links to the other pages as well as social media and contact links</li>
</ul>
